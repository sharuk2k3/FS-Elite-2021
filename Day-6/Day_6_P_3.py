Tejaswi playing a game. Game has a display of N numbers in a row, nums[].
Tejaswi has to pick the numbers one after the other.

Once Tejaswi picks a number num[i], she will score num[i] points and 
the number will be disappared on the board, simultaneously all the numbers 
having the value num[i]+1 or num[i]-1 also disappears. 

Tejaswi has to select the numbers, such that no more numbers will be left over 
on the board.

Tejaswi wants to score maximum number of points.

Initially Tejaswi has 0 points with her.
Can you help Tejaswi to score maximum number of points.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1 -> an integers N, number of numbers on the game board.
Line-2 -> N space separated integers, numbers on the game board nums[].

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer as result, maximum score she can get.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3
4 5 3

Sample Output-1:
----------------
8

Explanation:

    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += num
        
    f = len(freq)
    if f == 0:
        return 0
    if f <= 2:
        return max(freq)
    t = dict()
    t[0] = freq[0]
    t[1] = max(freq[0], freq[1])
    for i in range(2,f):
        t[i] = max(t[i-1], freq[i] + t[i-2])    
    return t[f-1]
n=int(input())
nums=list(map(int,input().split()))[:n]
