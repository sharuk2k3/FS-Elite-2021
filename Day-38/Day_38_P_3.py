If you shoot i-th bottle, you will get bottle[i-1]*bottle[i]*bottle[i+1] points.
The more points you score, the more rewards you can win.

Your task is to score the maximum points by shooting all the ballons wisely.

Note: After you shoot bottle at i-th index, bottles at i-1 and i+1 positions
become adjacent. if there is no existing 'i-1' or 'i+1' positions for selected bottle.
you can assume that bottle[i-1] = bottle[i+1] = 1.

Input Format:
