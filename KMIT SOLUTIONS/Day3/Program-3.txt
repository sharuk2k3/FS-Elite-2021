all the odd length sticks should be arranged to appear first in the bunch.

Print the length of the sticks, after arranging them according to above conditions. 

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of sticks in the bunch
Line-2: N space separated integers, lengths of the sticks.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of length of the sticks after arrangements accordingly.
