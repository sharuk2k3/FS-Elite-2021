'''
An Isosceles triangle is a triangle having two sides with equal in length.
for example: three points i, j, k are given, if the distance between i and j, 
i and k are equal. So that, i, j, k can form isosceles triangle.

You are given n points in a flat surface, the point consist of x and y co-ordinates.
Your task is to findout the number of isosceles triangles can be formed.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1 : An integer N.
Next N lines : Two space separated integers, x & y coordinates.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integers, number of Isosceles triangles


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3
0 0
1 0
2 0

Sample Output-1:
----------------
2

Explanation:
------------
The two isosceles triangles are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
