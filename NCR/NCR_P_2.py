========
Given two integers N and B, the task is to print the maximum index a pointer, 
starting from 0th index can reach in an array of natural numbers(i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5â€¦), 
say arr[], in N steps without placing itself at index B at any point.
Jumping Index = Current Index + Step Number
Input: N = 3, B = 2
Output: 6

Step 1:
Current Index = 0
Step Number = 1
Jumping Index = 0 + 1 = 1

Step 2:
Current Index = 1
Step Number = 2
Jumping Index = 1 + 2 = 3

Step 3:
Current Index = 3
Step Number = 3
Jumping Index = 3 + 3 = 6
Therefore, the maximum index that can be reached is 6.
